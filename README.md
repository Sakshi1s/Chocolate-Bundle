# Chocolate-Bundle

HTML Structure:

I have organized my HTML with clear divisions for each chocolate item, making it easy to add or modify items.
Each item has an image, a name, and an input field for quantity.


CSS Styling:

CSS provides a clean and responsive layout. It styles the chocolate items, images, and buttons for a visually appealing user interface.


JavaScript Logic:

The calculateTotalPrice function is comprehensive, handling each chocolate item individually, checking if the entered quantity exceeds 8, and alerting the user if it does.
I have included a specific alert message for each chocolate item.
The total price is calculated correctly based on the entered quantities and respective prices.


User Feedback:

I have incorporated alert messages to notify users when the quantity exceeds the limit for each chocolate type.
The total price is displayed clearly after the calculations.


Input Restriction:

I have restricted the input fields to allow only non-negative integers.
